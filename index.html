          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>I struggled in schools as a youth and found myself acceling in "Alternative School". After graduation, I attended Mt. Hood Community College for a year before dropping out. I took about 7 years off in order to work full-time. I went back to school at night when I was 24, but ended up enrolling full-time at Portland Community College when I was 26. When I was 28 I transferred to Portland State to major in Social Science and graduated from there in 2013. I took a year off but then went to Oregon State to obtain my Masters in Counseling in 2019. I am currently a student at Epicodus in Portand. </p>
          <h2>Work</h2>
          <p>I have worked in a lot of different places, in a lot of different fields. I suppose that's inevitable when you started working at 15 and are currently 38. My first real, legal, "over-the-counter" job was at Subway when I was 16. I quit randomly, and abruptly, because I prefered to be doing something else. The longest place I worked was at Parkrose High Shool. I was a Counselor for 9 years. This was buttressed by stints in mortgage, coffee shops, bike shops, and other odd jobs. </p>
