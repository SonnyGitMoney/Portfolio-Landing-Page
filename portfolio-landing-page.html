          </li>
          <li>goodbye (html): My second project, that also, was just an exercise in html changes and Gitwork.</li>
          <li>goodbyes.html (html...obvs.): My accidental third project that was the result of a learning brain somehow making a second.</li>

            <li>vacationsite (html, css, bootstrap): We hope you enjoy yourself with our lavish packages to travel Ukraine this time of year. I think this is a <em>"if we're not laughing we're crying"</em> type of thing</li>
